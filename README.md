# Website-Materials
A repository for my website projects (see https://gabriele-donato.github.io/gabrieledonato/)

The present repository will gather the codes for the projects presented on my websites, I plan to use mainly jupyter notebooks. The projects will be heterogeneous and will focus mainly on scraping, data-engineering and Bayesian statistics. For the Bayesian project the source of inspiration are the lessons of professor Roberto Casarin (University Ca' Foscari of Vencie). His approach is different from those of the mainstream, but not less valuable, resources in that he made us perform full calculations, and avoid the use of libraries. 

More recently, I have seen that writing a custom sampling procedure or using low-level code is not commonly done. On the other hand, I believe that this is a fundamental learning step and precisely what has made a difference in my knowledge-absorption process (compare my Bayesian code with the commonest alternatives).

I am available for clarifications, and possible criticisms: feel free to contact me at any time, I will be more than happy to discuss the various projects!

# Most Importantly

This project was born **free**: I do not have academic or job-related obligations to work on it. For this reason I have the strong belief that in the next years an innovative Bayesian library will be available for the general use: any contribution is welcome!

# Can't see anything? 

This repository is organised in independent branches since they all participate to the same project (my journey in the world of Python and statistics), however they represent very different (but interrelated and mutually useful) subjects. Check the different branches in the box on the top-left.
