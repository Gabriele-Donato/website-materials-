# Where are we heading? 

This branch of the depository is devoted to Bayesian Time Series analysis. As I explain in the main branch, the original inspiration for my Bayesian projects are the lessons of professor Roberto Casarin (University Ca' Foscari of Venice), who introduced us to a library-free approach.
I deem his teachings fundamental to my understanding of this subject. 
In the  Python implementations currently available, one is forced to learn a number of intricate commands (often combining under the hood more than one library). In my opinion this 
adds several layers of complexity for the learner.
Paradoxically, making things more complex by needing a low-level knowledge of the algorithms and procedures, ends up simplifying the matter. Indeed, once the basic techniques have been mastered, it is possible to
generalise them with ease.

# A realistic contribution 

Building on the understanding presented above, my contribution is devoted to the creation of a series of classes and functions for performing advanced Bayesian time series analysis. 
This choice derives from the fact that the libraries available make
this type of analysis particularly unintuitive, and I felt several times the necessity of a more specialised tool. 
For these reasons, I believe it to be an achievable objective that of providing a state-of-the-art library under the constraining condition of working alone. 
Moreocver, the repository is complemented by a website that gathers all the derivations
used in the coding part (which may be easily tuned in a student-friendly documentation).

# How do I plan to work? 

I plan to work systematically on the [website](https://gabriele-donato.github.io/gabrieledonato/) and repository, and sporadically on this branch. 

1) The first stages of developement will see different techniques being developed in isolation and in the most basic form.
2) The second state will se the instroduction of function that allow customisation.
3) The third stage will see the integration of the different components, and will be carried together with the final stage.
4) The final stage will be the developement of some AI feature for the cleaning and analysis of data.

I envisage the introduction of the elements in 4) as a step enabling lean and intuitive application of the function allowing the user to focus on modeling aspects, with a code that helps the user respecting model assumptions and functions being suggested in automatic (in order to flatten the learning curve of a new tool).
At the same time I believe that the combination of these features, combined with a code accessible in both the integrated version of 3), and the disaggregated version that will characterise the developement phases, will provide valuable educational tools.
